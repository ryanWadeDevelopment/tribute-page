                God gave Israel a son. Joseph was one of many brothers. His
                brothers were the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah. Bilhah and Zilpah
                were Joseph's father's wives. (His father was Jacob.)

                Jacob makes an ornate coat for Joseph. God worked through this
                event because if Jacob had not given Joseph this coat, a spur of
                events would not have happened in retrospect. The coat made
                Joseph's brothers jealous. They had thought Jacob was favoring
                Joseph, his youngest son.

                God gave Joseph a dream one night. He dreamt that his brothers'
                sheeves were bowing down to his own sheeves as they rose. His
                brothers hated him even more for this. He then had another dream
                that the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to him.
                He told this to his brothers and father. The brothers were
                jealous, but his father kept the matter in his mind.

                One afternoon, Joseph's father sent him to check on his brothers
                who were tending their flocks. When his brothers saw him
                arriving, they quickly planned to kill him. Reuben suggested
                that they should not harm him, but only throw him in the
                cistern. God worked through Reuben to save Joseph's life. Judah
                later formulated the plan to sell Joseph to the Midianite
                merchants, who later sold him to Egypt. The brothers convinced
                Jacob that Joseph was eaten. He mourned for days.

                Joseph was made a slave to an Egyptian master. But the master
                saw that God was with Joseph, and make him his attendant. The
                pharaoh's wife had begged Joseph to sleep with her repeatedly,
                but God gave Joseph the strength to resist. One day, the wife
                lied to the pharoah and said Joseph had begged her to sleep with
                him. So the pharaoh sent Joseph to prison. But the prison warden
                saw that God was with Joseph and put him in charge.

                The pharaoh saw that God was with Joseph and allowed Joseph back
                into his palace. He then made Joseph the king of Egypt. For
                seven years, Joseph traveled all throughout Egypt and stored up
                large quantities of grain. When the abundance was over, the
                famine began and lasted for seven years. The people of Egypt
                were well-fed because they lived off of the grain Joseph stored.
                Soon, people all throughout the world were coming to pay for
                Joseph's grain.

                The famine was still running, and God had sent the effect to
                Joseph's brothers. Israel sent ten of the brothers to buy grain
                in Egypt. When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but
                pretended he didn't. His brothers didn't recognize him either.
                Joseph insisted to them that they were spies and imprisoned
                them.

                Joseph made a deal with his imprisoned brothers. Joseph's
                brothers told him that their youngest brother, Benjamin, was
                still with Israel in Canaan. So Joseph said that if they left
                one brother in prison and came back with Benjamin, he would let
                them all go. This showed faith in God to know that they would
                come back. However, Israel refused to allow it.

                When God had sent the famine onto Joseph's brothers again, their
                father allowed them to take Benjamin back to Egypt. Once they
                arrived and Joseph saw that Benjamin was there, he invited them
                for dinner. At the sight of all of his brothers, Joseph became
                very emotional and left the room to weep. He then bestowed
                himself and ate freely with his brothers. He gave Benjamin a
                portion five times as much as anyone else.

                Once God had silenced their hunger, Joseph sent his brothers off
                to their home with their wheat and silver. Beforehand, he
                slipped his silver cup into Benjamin's sack. Through his
                servant, Joseph ran out towards them and played the victim,
                asking why they had stole his cup. He made the deal that whoever
                was found with the cup, would have to be his servant. When
                Benjamin was found with it, Judah explained to Joseph that if
                Benjamin were to stay, their father would surely die of sadness.

              When it got to a point where he could no longer take it, Joseph
              admitted to his brothers that he was, in fact, their brother. He
              then forewarned them that the famine God had sent will last for
              five more years and invited them to live with him in the best of
              Egypt. He also gave them new clothes (five times more for
              Benjamin) and donkeys, and sent them on their way. He also
              instructed them to bring back his father.

                This had been long after many events. Long after the struggle
                with the famine and the end of it, long after Jacob had given
                his sons blessings and past on, and long after Joseph reassured
                his brothers that they are forgiven for treating him poorly so
                long ago. God decided that it was Joseph's time to join in
                heaven at the age of 110. He told his brothers that God will
                surely come to their aid and take them out of the land and into
                the land he promised. He was buried in a coffin in Egypt.
